# HumanConnect

HumanConnect allows users to visualize their movement, food intake, and location data - and share the information with select friends via a social network. 

It uses HumanAPI and its partner wellness applications to pull user wellness data. Currently we have it set up to work with the "Moves" app and "Misfit Wearables" apps and devices.

General user features:
* View historical step data (d3)
* View daily locations (Google Maps)
* View food intake information
* View other users on platform
* Request to follow other users
* If accepted, view other users step, location, and food intake data
